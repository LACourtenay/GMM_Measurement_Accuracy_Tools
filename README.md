This code has been designed for the open-access free R software, with some extensions in Python. This is easy to use by simply executing each line of code within either the R shell, or when applicable in python (via jupyter notebook, for example). The two languages in this study were combined using R-Studio. 

<b> Additional formatting of the actual code may be needed if these tools are to be applied to different landmark configuration models. </b>

all geometric morphometric data are provided within this repository. For ease of use, these files have been formatted in the style of <b> morphologika </b>.

 <b> Note! In some cases we have experienced problems working with the "asbio" R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/asbio/asbio.pdf). From this package a single function is used, therefore if the analyst experiences problems with installing or loading this package, we have included this single function in the R folder. The analyst can simply copy and paste this function into their R code for it to work. Please note that all credit for this function goes to the authros of this package and is not intelectual property of the corresponding author.
